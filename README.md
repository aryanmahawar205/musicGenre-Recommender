## This SongRecommender ML Model is trained as per the following steps

Data was imported via csv file. This data had inconsistency which was predicted by the model with a certain level of accuracy. <br> <br>
The Data could have been also cleaned. Essentially cleaning of Data was not done in this model. <br>
Splitting the Data into Training and Testing sets with 8 : 2 ratio. <br>
Creating a model. Here we have used Decision Tree Algorithm. <br>
Training the model with the Training set. <br>
Making Predictions with certain level of accuracy. <br>
Evaluating and improving accuracy by fine tuning procedures. Not done for this particular model. <br>
